    <p1>Unjustly defamed by their association with a deadly sin, <br />
        sloths have shaken off their bad press to become one of the
        world's most beloved tree-hugging mammals.
    </p1>
    <br />
    <p1>Sloths—the sluggish tree-dwellers of Central and South America
        —spend their lives in the tropical rain forests. <br />
        They move through
        the canopy at a rate of about 40 yards per day, munching on leaves,
        twigs and buds. <br />
        Sloths have an exceptionally low metabolic rate and
        spend 15 to 20 hours per day sleeping. <br />
        And surprisingly enough, the
        long-armed animals are excellent swimmers.
        They occasionally drop from
        their treetop perches into water for a paddle.
    </p1>


    <p>There are two different types of sloths:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Two-toed</li>
        <li>Three-toed</li>
    </ul>
    <p>And and six species:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Pygmy three-toed sloth</li>
        <li>Maned sloth</li>
        <li>Pale-throated sloth</li>
        <li>Brown-throated sloth</li>
        <li>Linnaeus's two-toed sloth</li>
        <li>Hoffman's two-toed sloth</li>
    </ul>
